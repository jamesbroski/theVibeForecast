# theVibeForecast

As a musically inclined weather enthusiast

I want to enter in my current city

So I can see the current weather

I want to be able store a few cities in the navigation bar

So I can save the last few cities I searched

I want to listen to songs that relate to the weather vibes in the city

So I can listen to the songs

I want to be able to like and save songs

So that I can replay songs that I liked.
